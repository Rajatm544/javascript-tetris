![Logo of the app](./android-chrome-192x192.png)

-   This is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
-   It includes the 7 original tetrimino shapes, and works with a keydown event being fired to move/rotate the piece.
-   The game starts by moving a piece down by a square every 750ms, and you get 10 points for every row you complete filling.
-   The game's level goes up for every 100 points scored, after which the speed with which the piece moves down increases, therby increasing the difficulty of the game.
